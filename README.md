- Here are some scripts, that are compatible with SH59_Keysystem:
- [esx_carlock (optimized fork)](https://github.com/SteakHarpyie59/esx_carlock)

## Changes in comparison to V1
âš  Important if your are Upgrading from [SH59_Keysystem](https://github.com/SteakHarpyie59/sh59_keysystem) (V1)
```diff
+ An (optional) rework with ox_lib
+ Security improvements in server.lua
+ Keeping most of the compatibility with scripts that were made for SH59_Keysystem (V1)
- Deprecation of sh59_KeySystem:RemoveMoney event
! Some NetEvents are now normal server-to-setver events
```
> Following events are no longer NetEvents, but just normal server-to-server Events, due to security reasons:
> - sh59_KeySystem:GiveKey
> - sh59_KeySystem:RemoveKey
> - sh59_KeySystem:RemoveAllKeys
